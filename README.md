# Factors-Influencing-US-Home-Prices
Task - Using publically available data for the national factors that impact supply and demand of homes in US, build a model to study the effect of these variables on home prices.

Approach - The following variables are chosen for the study-

1. Unemployment Rate
2. Per Capita GDP
3. Median Household Income
4. Construction Prices
5. CPI
6. Interest Rates
7. Number of new houses supplied
8. Working Population
9. Urban Population
10. Percentage of population above 65
11. Housing subsidies
12. Number of Households
As a proxy to the home prices, S&P CASE-SHILLER Index is used.

A few variables that could have been studied are below.

1. Net-immigration (It is supposed to have a positive impact. No suitable data could be found)
2. Marriage Rate (People tend to buy homes after they get married. So, it might have some effect. No data could be found)
3. Average house size (The data was available only for the years after 2015. Though it is expected that an increase in the average house size would increase prices, it is found that the average home size has been 4. consistently decreasing although the prica has been increasing)
5. Land availability (Less land, higher prices. Perhaps this is why the prices has been rising even though the average house size has been decreasing. No relevant data could be found)
6. Tax Rate (Too many brackets (7) and could not analyse due to time)
7. Number of active listings (Data prior to 2017 was not found)
